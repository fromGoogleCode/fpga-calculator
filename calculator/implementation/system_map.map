Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,689 out of   4,896   34%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,621 out of   4,896   53%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,855 out of   2,448   75%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,855 out of   1,855 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,855   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,767 out of   4,896   56%
    Number used as logic:             2,217
    Number used as a route-thru:        146
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     148

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 50 out of     108   46%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      33
