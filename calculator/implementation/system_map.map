Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,729 out of   4,896   35%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,622 out of   4,896   53%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,874 out of   2,448   76%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,874 out of   1,874 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,874   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,768 out of   4,896   56%
    Number used as logic:             2,218
    Number used as a route-thru:        146
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     148

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 49 out of     108   45%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      33
  Number of RAMB16s:                      9 out of      12   75%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      12   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.49

Peak Memory Usage:  329 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  40 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   36 secs
